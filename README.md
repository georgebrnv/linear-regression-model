# PyTorch Linear Regression: The Learning Chronicles

## About This Repository

This repository houses my inaugural PyTorch linear regression model. While not groundbreaking, it represents the first step in my machine learning journey.

## Contents

* A functional linear regression implementation
* Room for optimization and improvement

## Quick Start

1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements.txt
3. Run model.py

## Notes

This project demonstrates basic PyTorch functionality for educational purposes. It prioritizes clarity over optimization and serves as a foundation for more complex models to come.

Contributions and constructive feedback welcome.
